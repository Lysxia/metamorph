synopsis:
  Monomorphize polymorphic properties
description:
  Given a polymorphic property or function, find a monomorphic instance such
  that correctness for that instance implies correctness for all other
  instances.
  .
  With some types, the testing space becomes ridiculously small.
  For example, a function with type:
  .
  > f :: forall a. [a] -> [a]
  .
  is fully determined by its behavior on lists @[1 .. n]@.
  Observing the image of a single list is sufficient to determine whether @f@
  is correct for all lists of the same length.
  .
  @metamorph@ systematically computes the Rightâ„¢ set of test cases for a
  property, just by looking at its type.
  .
  Based on ideas from the paper /Testing Polymorphic Properties/,
